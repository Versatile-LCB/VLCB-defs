# VLCB-defs
This repo is for the control of MERG VLCB-defs files. It allows a variety of language specific cbus definitions files from a 
single version controlled source CSV file, vlcb-defs.csv

This code is a fork from https://github.com/MERG-DEV/cbusdefs that contains the same
definition files for CBUS. 
This repo builds on CBUSDEFS and adds the definitions used by VLCB.

# Contents

Do NOT edit any of the language specific VLCB-defs files, edit only vlcb-defs.csv and generate the language files from that.

There are a number of generator scripts for each supported programming language.
These generator scripts are Bash scripts that can be executed using "Git Bash" which is part of the git download (https://git-scm.com/downloads) or by 
any other suitable Bash shell.
_generate.sh_ is a "master" script that runs all the generator scripts.
The language specific scripts can be run individually to only generate file(s) for that language.

The current generator script produces the following output files from the vlcb-defs.csv:
1.	vlcbdefs.h   - C and C++ using #define
2.  vlcbdefs_enum.h - C using enum constants
1.	vlcbdefs.hpp - C++ using enum constants
2.	vlcbdefs.inc - Assembler
3.	vlcbdefs.pas - Object Pascal (Delphi)
4.  vlcbcefs.cs	 - C#.NET 5.0 (Core)
5.	java/\*      - Java
6.  vlcbdefs.py  - Python
7.  vlcbdefs.js  - JavaScript

# New versions of VLCB-defs
VLCB-defs will be updated from time to time, in line with changes to the VLCB spec or addition of new module types and/or manufacturer codes.

**TODO**: Once VLCB-defs is stable and proven useful, generated zip for each new release shall also be uploaded to the MERG knowledgebase
(https://www.merg.org.uk/merg_wiki/doku.php?id=vlcb:vlcb-headers). Note: You must be a MERG member to access this page.

# Process to update VLCB-defs
Whenever a new version of VLCB-defs is released then the respective changes in VLCB-defs.csv can be made and the _generate.sh_ script used to 
regenerate the language specific files. Once the language specific files have been generated then all the changes can be pushed back to github 
with a commit comment referencing the version number.

A new branch is created on GitHub for each new release, the GitHub release process is carried out on that branch, which is then merged back into master after
release.

Updates to the original cbusdefs can be merged in to this repo.
Be careful to resolve any conflicts carefully.

Users of this repo can pull a new copy and access the language specific files directly.

A zip of the new generated files can also be uploaded onto the MERG Knowledgebase/Wiki for those who do not use GitHub.

For WIP working towards a new version, a branch can be created for that development and changes applied there.  This means that master will always reflect the latest released version.

Co-ordination of changes to VLCB-defs is currently being managed by Sven Rosvall, sven@rosvall.ie

Version 8x released 12/11/23  Added some module type ids and manufacturer id
Version 8y WIP as of Jan 24, not yet released.

# How to use VLCB-Defs in Your Project
The best way to use these definitions in your project is to copy the `vlcbdefs.xxx` file
for the language you are using into the source code of your project. 

Whenever there is an update to VLCB-Defs, copy the updated `vlcbdefs.xxx` file to your
project and make sure that it still compiles. 
At this point you can change your code to make use of new definitions from VLCB-Defs.

It is not recommended to use VLCB-Defs as a separate resource that must be copied or cloned
separately. 
Any such copies/clones may be updated and if such updates are not compatible with
your project it will not work properly. 
Managing change control this way is difficult.
Having a copy of `vlcbdefs.xxx` in your project ensures that all code is updated
in a controlled way.
